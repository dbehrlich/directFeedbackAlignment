##Documentation

Simple code to demonstrate Direct Feedback Alignment training of neural networks. Network with 2 hidden layers is trained to perform the xor computation. Same weight initializations trained using both DFA and Backpropagation for comparison.

DFA algorithm is implemented as described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01596).

dfa.m will run and plot all results
